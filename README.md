### Hej!

Iâ€™m a Stockholm based developer who likes building interfaces and handling data for services made to play a vital role in peopleâ€™s lives. At the moment these things occupy my developer mind:

ðŸ”µ Doing a course in different aspects of the backend, trying to gain basic knowledge.

ðŸ”µ A little [note web app](https://github.com/kristofferlarberg/post-it) built with Vue.js.
